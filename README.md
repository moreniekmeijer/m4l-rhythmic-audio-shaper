# M4L Rhythmic Audio Shaper

This is a Max for Live device (.amxd) which takes audio and can chop it into different rhythmic patterns. Download the .amxd file for Ableton. I included a maxpat as well.

This device is work in progress. I already updated it three times because of some fixes I had to make. Let me know if stuff is not working! 
I really want to know this, also for my own learning curve. Have fun making music!
